#The Kompiler Logo/Emblem


Logo of the Kompiler organisation (http://kompiler.no).

Kompiler is the serious twin-organisation of Pils & Programming (http://pilsprog.no).

## Usage
The emblem is designed to be used in combination with the Ubuntu Sans font in either white or a dark gray (#333) colour. The umbrella can be used in any colour either on its own or as negative space in a rounded rectangle.

If in doubt send me an email: torstein@thunemedia.no
